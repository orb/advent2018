## Methodology

I try to solve the AoC problems with a good balance between speed and readability/style. I write test cases for my code, but I don't test robustly in he interest of getting things done. I aim for correctness in a general sense (beyond just gettting the right answer for my input), but if there are edge cases, under-specified things I don't stress over them if they don't affect the inputs. I spend a little more time in areas I feel like I need practice in. (like using instaparse for parsing when I could brute hack some regular expressions) I will sometimes refactor for clarity, time permitting, but I'm perfectly happy to leave an ugly solution as is otherwise.  I always keep my part1 and part2 code running, even when the part2 code is just not obviously compattible with part1.
